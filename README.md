## What LIRI does
The Liri Bot acts like the personal assistant, Siri on our iPhones. Liri will take in commands and return data back to the user. If the user is in search of a song, this will take in the user's inputs to find a song with the title, artist name, provides a preview link of the song from Spotify and which album it is from. For those searching for concerts in town, their search results will pull up the name of the venue, location, and date of the event. Liri can also search for movies and provide the Movie Title, Year it came out, IMDB rating, Rotten Tomato rating, Country where it was produced, language, the plot, and the actors in the film.

The app works  by taking in the user input to search the various APIs for the requested info.

The following APIs were used:
Spotify - used to search for songs in their database

OMDB - searched for movie info 

Bands in Town - Retrieved concert info 

## Technology Used
inquirer - Prompt the user in situations where search criteria is left out

dotenv - used to securely protect the API keys

Moment.js - used to format display the event dates and times correctly
